            <p>But I must Rony explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                born
                and I
                will give
                you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
                truth,
                the
                master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
                pleasure, but
                because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
                extremely
                painful. Nor
                again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
                because
                occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a
                trivial example,
                which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But
                who
                has any right
                to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
                avoids a pain
                that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
                dislike
                men who are
                so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they
                cannot
                foresee</p>
